## Personal List of Info/Updates
I will store all the info I need here for safe keeping, in case there are long breaks between work on this project.
The example website is [here](https://academicpages.github.io/) for reference.

Originally informed from Professor Niema: [his page](https://niema.net/) and [his source](https://github.com/niemasd/niemasd.github.io)

# Need To Do:
1. Update pages (located in `/_pages`)
    1. edit `about.md`
        - make a list of recent projects on front page
        - add photos of some sort?
    2. add and edit `resume.md`
        - make it so my resume is downloadable
        - list out resume and just have downloadable link (when more things available to add on)
    3. add and edit `projects.md`
        - add ease of access guides (i.e. links to different spots in the page)
        - separate in class projects and personal projects in sections
2. Add functionalities to pages
    1. make it so `projects.md` will automatically post when new GitHub post is made

# Useful Tips
* `CTRL + Shift + V` produces and preview of a markdown file in VSCode
* `/_pages/example_pages` contains the sample pages
    * there are often many extras associated with each sample page (i.e. `/_portfolio` contains posts used in the page `portfolio.html`)
