Hello! As a current second-year Computer Science major at UCSD, I'm looking to expand my arsenal of coding languages and broaden my experiences in software development. I have been working with Java and C for over a year, just recently picking up C++ at the start of 2024. I also have experience with ARM Assembly, Bash, and GitHub. I'm currently welcoming any opportunites for internships/part-time work in any software development related field, so please contact me by any means using my social media outlets listed on the left.

You can access [my resume](http://dylantrann.github.io/resume/) and [projects portfolio](http://dylantrann.github.io/projects/) using the navigation bar above or pressing the links included here.
