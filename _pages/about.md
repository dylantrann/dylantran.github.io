Hello! As a current second-year Computer Science major at UCSD, I'm looking to expand my arsenal of coding languages and broaden my experiences in software development. 

I have been working with Java and C for over a year, just recently picking up C++ at the start of 2024. I also have experience with ARM Assembly, Bash, and GitHub.
